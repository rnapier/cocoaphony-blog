    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve travelled to China several times, and now I&rsquo;m working with large group of developers in Suzhou, Hangzhou and Hefei. A few weeks ago I was able to visit again, and that&rsquo;s gotten me back in the mood to study Chinese. It often helps me to write down things as I learn them, and some of my Chinese coworkers read this blog and might help set me straight as I wander through their language like a bull in a China shop (as it were&hellip;.) It&rsquo;s a bit off the trail for Cocoa development, so feel free to use the Subscribe2 link on the right to take this category off of your email subscription.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently studying speaking with <a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Chinese-Mandarin/Chinese-Mandarin-I-Comprehensive/9780671790615">Pimsleur Chinese Mandarin I Comprehensive</a>. I&rsquo;ve found it useful so far, and it seems a good way to learn pronunciation. Of course that can get you in trouble. It is somewhat problematic to learn very well how to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak well&rdquo; (我说的不好). It gives the impression you are being modest, when in fact it is about the only thing you know how to say. I would have done better to study &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin&rdquo; (我不会说普通话).</p>

<p>To learn writing, I&rsquo;ve been studying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Write-Chinese-Characters-Language/dp/0300057717">Learn to Write Chinese Characters</a> by Johan Björkstén. Reviewers have been very complimentary of its focus on the aesthetics of beautiful and correct drawn characters rather than simply how to print them like a book would. I trust them for now that the focus on beauty is also good for learning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still on the lookout for a good dictionary. I use Google translate and wiktionary a lot, but I don&rsquo;t like either. I&rsquo;d like to find a good online resource that will take a character and give the pinyin and translation, as well as the reverse. A book form would be useful as well of course, though I&rsquo;m still working on stroke counting and order, so that makes it hard to look things up.</p>
