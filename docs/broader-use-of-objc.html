<div class="entry-content"><p><i>Based on a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/874690/is-objective-c-only-used-for-development-on-mac-os-iphone/874837">post</a> at StackOverflow. The question was whether Objective-C is only used for development on Mac OS/iPhone and why.</i></p>

<p>I think ObjC has been isolated to the Apple world through a quirk of history and the nature of proprietary systems.</p>

<p>First, you need to separate ObjC from Cocoa. ObjC is a very primitive language. I think it is a very elegant language, but it is extremely basic. You can implement ObjCv1 in a C pre-processor. C++ and ObjC were developed about the same time. C++ put a huge amount of infrastructure in place to bring a C-like syntax to what is basically a completely different language. ObjC brought a Smalltalk-like syntax to C, with almost nothing else. Even things like +alloc and -release aren&rsquo;t language elements of ObjC. They&rsquo;re fairly simple wrappers around malloc() and free().<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[*]</a></sup> Standing on its own, ObjC isn&rsquo;t really that interesting (elegant as I think it is). This is very similar to the nature of Smalltalk. Without its object libraries, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do with it. With its object libraries, it&rsquo;s incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>NeXT provided this entire framework on top of ObjC called NeXTSTEP. Since the NeXT computer was not a widespread commercial success, and NeXTSTEP was proprietary, not many people learned the framework or the underlying language. When Apple bought it and morphed it into Cocoa, it continued to be a proprietary system.</p>

<p>GNUStep is out there, but they never developed anything interesting enough to bring in a lot of developers (a major web browser or word processor or the like). And Cocoa has gotten well ahead of GNUStep over the last few years. It&rsquo;s possible that with the rise of interest in Cocoa due to iPhone, GNUStep may finally revitalize and bring a nice cross-platform development framework, but I doubt it. Folks who have a background in C++ look at C# and see a clear improvement. When they look at ObjC, they see a lot of square brackets where they don&rsquo;t expect them. For people raised on the &ldquo;calling methods&rdquo; paradigm, the Smalltalk paradigm of &ldquo;passing messages&rdquo; is alien and even a bit scary. Many developers assume they need a strongly typed language to avoid bugs and are uncomfortable with a system that relies primarily on programmer discipline and careful consistency. It is much easier to hack something that &ldquo;just works&rdquo; in C# than in ObjC. ObjC really expects a lot more of the developer in understanding what&rsquo;s going on and not relying on the compiler to protect you from your hacks.</p>

<p>Basically, folks knew C from Unix, and C++ makes sense in terms of C, and Java makes sense in terms of C++, and C# is just cleaned up Java. ObjC isn&rsquo;t any of these. It&rsquo;s Smalltalk, and no one learns Smalltalk anymore.</p>

<p><sup><a name="footnote-1">[*]</a></sup> I recently chatted with the guy who wrote +alloc about its history, and he might object to my calling it a simple wrapper given the inclusion of zones. So for you who know the difference, replace +alloc here with +new.</p>
