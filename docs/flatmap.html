<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>In which our heroes create for themselves a convenience and discover a
surprising thing.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="/maps">Last time</a> we looked at the incredible little <code>map</code> function, and saw
how it could be used to simplify a lot of tedious for-loops while making our
code more clear and less error-prone. This time, we&rsquo;re going to see if we can
solve a common problem that happens with mapping, nesting.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>When we left our heroes</h2>

<p>First, a very quick recap on mapping. We can use <code>map</code> to transform an array of
elements into an new array of different elements. For example, we can transform
an array of strings into an array of string lengths in a variety of syntaxes:</p>

<pre><code>let domains = ["apple.com", "google.com", "robnapier.net"]
let lengths = domains.map { countElements($0) }
let lengths = map(domains) { countElements($0) }
let lengths = domains.map(countElements)
let lengths = map(domains, countElements)
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could transform an array of strings into an array of URLs:</p>

<pre><code>let urls = domains.map { NSURL(scheme: "http", host: $0, path: "/") }
</code></pre>

<p>We learned that we can map optionals and our custom
<a href="https://gist.github.com/rnapier/42ef28d52ac92744730f">result</a> type.
In both cases, successful values (<code>Some</code>, <code>Success</code>) are transformed with the
function, while failing values (<code>None</code>, <code>nil</code>, <code>Failure</code>) are simply returned.
In this way, mapping is very similar to optional chaining (<code>?.</code>).</p>

<p>We discovered that the different <code>map</code> functions all have the same &ldquo;shape&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>map(Array&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; U) -&gt; Array&lt;U&gt;
map(Optional&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; U) -&gt; Optional&lt;U&gt;
map(Result&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; U) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;
// or more generally:
map(F&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; U) -&gt; F&lt;U&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Learning to see these shapes helps us find patterns we can reuse and combine.</p>

<p>For more introduction, see
<a href="/functional-wish-fulfillment">Functional Wish Fulfillment</a> and
<a href="/maps">Maps&hellip;Wait, They Don&rsquo;t Love You Like I Love You</a>.</p>

<h2>Boxes in boxes</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/rnapier/e0d91580d613fb21a52b">simple example</a> to get
ourselves started on a new problem. We have customers with some properties:</p>

<pre><code>struct Customer {
  let name: String
  let emails: [String]
}

let customers = [
  Customer(name: "Alice", emails: ["alice@example.com"]),
  Customer(name: "Bob", emails: ["bob@example.org", "bobby@home.example"])
]
</code></pre>

<p>Now we&rsquo;d like a list of all our customer names for our upcoming report. Easy!</p>

<pre><code>let names = customers.map { $0.name }
// ["Alice", "Bob"]
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect. Just what we want. Now, we also have had a major security issue and
need to alert all of our users at all of their email addresses. Let&rsquo;s grab
those:</p>

<pre><code>let emails = customers.map { $0.emails }
// [["alice@example.com"], ["bob@example.org", "bobby@home.example"]]
</code></pre>

<p>Wait. That&rsquo;s not quite what we meant. We wanted a list of email addresses, not a
list-of-lists of email addresses. What are we going to do now? I wouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if you&rsquo;ve encountered this before and fixed it with some kind of
&ldquo;flatten&rdquo; function that removes one layer of structure. It&rsquo;s slightly surprising
that Swift doesn&rsquo;t have one of these built in, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to
make.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>func flatten&lt;T&gt;(array: [[T]]) -&gt; [T] {
  var result = [T]()
  for subarray in array {
    result.extend(subarray)
  }
  return result
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that, let&rsquo;s try again:</p>

<pre><code>let flatEmails = flatten(customers.map { $0.emails })
// ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.org", "bobby@home.example"]
</code></pre>

<p>Great. Well, pretty great. There are a few small annoyances. Throwing
<code>flatten()</code> on the start is kind of tedious, especially if this is part of a
chain of maps and filters. Consider if we wanted these to be URLs. We&rsquo;d want to
do this:</p>

<pre><code>let emails =
  customers.map { $0.emails }
  .flatten      // &lt;== this isn't possible
  .map { NSURL(string:"mailto:\($0)") }
</code></pre>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not really possible in Swift. You can&rsquo;t easily add an Array extension
for <code>flatten</code> because it only applies to arrays of arrays. Swift can&rsquo;t apply
extensions only to certain kinds of arrays. So we&rsquo;re forced to do this:</p>

<pre><code>let emails =
  flatten(customers.map { $0.emails })
  .map { NSURL(string:"mailto:\($0)") }
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s kind of ugly, and gets worse if the chain is long and has multiple points
where flattening is needed.</p>

<p>Like I said, this &ldquo;map plus flatten&rdquo; is pretty common, so maybe it&rsquo;s worth
making a little convenience method for it that we could stick on Array. Let&rsquo;s
call it <code>flatMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
  func flatMap&lt;U&gt;(transform: T -&gt; [U]) -&gt; [U] {
    return flatten(self.map(transform))
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just like it says on the tin. Apply the map. Flatten. Ta-da! And now we can
call:</p>

<pre><code>let flatMapEmails = customers.flatMap { $0.emails }
// ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.org", "bobby@home.example"]
</code></pre>

<p>Just like we wanted.</p>

<h2>Flat all the things</h2>

<p>Since we can map optionals and <code>Result</code>, can we flatten them too? Let&rsquo;s look at
the shape of <code>flatten</code> and how it might apply:</p>

<pre><code>flatten(Array&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Array&lt;T&gt;
flatten(Optional&lt;Optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Optional&lt;T&gt;
flatten(Result&lt;Result&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So we could flatten a <code>T??</code> to <code>T?</code> or a <code>Result&lt;Result&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> to <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code>.
That makes sense and sounds useful.</p>

<pre><code>func flatten&lt;T&gt;(result: Result&lt;Result&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;T&gt; {
  switch result {
  case .Success(let box):
    switch box.unbox {
    case .Success(let nestedBox): return .Success(nestedBox)
    case .Failure(let err):       return .Failure(err)
    }
  case .Failure(let err): return .Failure(err)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if we can map and flatten, then of course we can write <code>flatMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>extension Result {
  func flatMap&lt;U&gt;(transform: T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt; {
    return flatten(self.map(transform))
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>What <em>is</em> this flatMap?</h2>

<p>That was easy enough to do, but who cares? Why would you ever want to do that?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the shape of this function. It&rsquo;s a method, so we put the type
of <code>self</code> as the first parameter to get a function form. That makes it easier
to compare shapes:</p>

<pre><code>flatMap(Result&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That looks very familiar. Back in
<a href="/functional-wish-fulfillment">Functional Wish Fulfillment</a> we developed a
function called <code>continueWith</code> that let us chain together functions so that we&rsquo;d
get a success if they all succeeded, and a failure if any of them failed. Here&rsquo;s
what it looked like:</p>

<pre><code>func continueWith&lt;T,U&gt;(x: Result&lt;T&gt;, f: T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt; {
  switch x {
  case .Success(let box): return f(box.unbox)
  case .Failure(let err): return .Failure(err)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using that, we were able to turn our big, complicated JSON parser, full of
conditional logic, into this:</p>

<pre><code>func pagesFromData(data: NSData) -&gt; Result&lt;[Page]&gt; {
  return continueWith(asJSON(data)) {     // data is NSData
    continueWith(asJSONArray($0)) {       // $0 is JSON (AnyObject)
      continueWith(secondElement($0)) {   // $0 is JSONArray ([AnyObject])
        continueWith(asStringList($0)) {  // $0 is JSON (AnyObject)
          asPages($0)                     // $0 is [String]
        } } } }                           // We return Result&lt;[Page]&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the shapes of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>     flatMap(Result&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;
continueWith(Result&lt;T&gt;, T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look familiar?</p>

<p>In functional programming, when two generic functions have the same shape, you
should have a strong suspicion that they are at least related. There may be
some more basic function that they both derive from, or they may turn out to be
the same thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with the fairly trivial (if slightly tedious) proof
that <code>continueWith</code> and <code>flatMap</code> are in fact the same function. You can work it
out on your own if you&rsquo;re interested, or see
<a href="https://gist.github.com/rnapier/b383d2542c9fabe913c9">my version in this gist</a>.
But I will call out two facts: (1) they are the same function, and (2) it&rsquo;s
possible to <em>prove</em> it.</p>

<h2>Proving the program</h2>

<p>I am not going to wander into the &ldquo;programming is math&rdquo; debate. It&rsquo;s a silly
argument. What is important, and should be incontrovertible, is that functional
programming makes it easier to use well-established tools that are common among
mathematicians. One of those tools is the proof. We use proofs all the time, we
just don&rsquo;t call them that. Every correct automatic refactoring is based on a
proof that the code before the refactor is identical to the code after the
refactor.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='An optimizing compiler in a strongly typed language is essentially a giant
proof engine.'></p>

<p>An optimizing compiler in a strongly typed language is essentially a giant
proof engine. When you get errors like
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25645689/97337">&ldquo;C is not convertible to Self,&rdquo;</a>
it means you asserted something that the compiler couldn&rsquo;t prove. It may mean
that you asserted something that isn&rsquo;t true, or it may mean that the proof
engine isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to prove it, or it may even mean that the language
isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to express what you are trying to assert.</p>

<p></span></p>

<p>Functional programming makes it is easier to apply proofs. In other words, it
makes your code easier to refactor mechanically and easier to optimize
performance. A key reason is the lack of mutable state. The more mutable state
is tied up in something, the harder it is to prove that a dramatically different
implementation behaves identically.</p>

<p>Test cases are not the same thing as a proof. I can&rsquo;t create enough test cases
to be certain that every number divisible by 6 is also divisible by 2 and 3.
It&rsquo;d take an infinite number of test cases. But if I prove it, I don&rsquo;t need any
tests at all. The key to making that easy is ensuring that <code>isDivisibleBySix(n:
Int) -&gt; Bool</code> relies on nothing but <code>n</code>. If there is no mutable state, if there
are no side effects, if it&rsquo;s just a function that takes a value and returns a
value, then I can much more easily replace it with a different implementation
and be confident it will behave the same.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to wander down this road too far. I&rsquo;m not arguing that we don&rsquo;t
need tests, and I&rsquo;m not arguing for proof-of-correctness as a general practice.
I&rsquo;m saying that if you understand the difference between test and proof, and
write your code in a way to favors proofs, you will get better code, fewer
tests, simpler refactoring, and safer performance optimizations. And step one
of that is the elimination of mutable state.</p>

<h2>A method to our functional madness</h2>

<p>OK, back to more hands-on, practical concerns.</p>

<p>We implemented <code>continueWith</code> as a function, but we implemented <code>flatMap</code> as an
extension method on <code>Result</code>. Does that change anything? Here&rsquo;s our
function-based syntax:</p>

<pre><code>func pagesFromData(data: NSData) -&gt; Result&lt;[Page]&gt; {
  return continueWith(asJSON(data)) {     // data is NSData
    continueWith(asJSONArray($0)) {       // $0 is JSON (AnyObject)
      continueWith(secondElement($0)) {   // $0 is JSONArray ([AnyObject])
        continueWith(asStringList($0)) {  // $0 is JSON (AnyObject)
          asPages($0)                     // $0 is [String]
        } } } }                           // We return Result&lt;[Page]&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using a method approach, here&rsquo;s what we get:</p>

<pre><code>func pagesFromData(data: NSData) -&gt; Result&lt;[Page]&gt; {
  return asJSON(data)
    .flatMap(asJSONArray)
    .flatMap(secondElement)
    .flatMap(asStringList)
    .flatMap(asPages)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely easier to read, understand, and modify. Swift syntax
tends to favor chaining methods over chaining functions. That&rsquo;s somewhat
unfortunate. Functions are easier to reason about (prove) because they don&rsquo;t
contain an implicit <code>self</code> that might hide state. Functions in Swift are also
much more flexible in how they can be made generic (type-parameterized). As we
saw before, it&rsquo;s not possible to write <code>flatten</code> as a method on a generic type.
Overuse of methods can get us into really frustrating situations if we want to
write really reusable code.</p>

<p>But the syntax favors methods&hellip; mostly.</p>

<p>Swift offers a very powerful way to chain together functions: operators.
Operators are just functions that allow some syntax benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>They don&rsquo;t require parentheses</li>
<li>They can be prefix (<code>!x</code>), infix (<code>x + y</code>) or postfix (<code>x++</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>So what if we defined an operator for <code>flatMap</code>? We&rsquo;ll call it <code>&gt;&gt;==</code> for
reasons I&rsquo;ll explain later.</p>

<pre><code>infix operator &gt;&gt;== {}
func &gt;&gt;== &lt;T,U&gt;(x: Result&lt;T&gt;, f:T -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;U&gt; {
  return x.flatMap(f)
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that, here&rsquo;s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/rnapier/067156ac404cc42f17b6">our new parser</a>:</p>

<pre><code>func pagesFromData(data: NSData) -&gt; Result&lt;[Page]&gt; {
  return asJSON(data)
    &gt;&gt;== asJSONArray
    &gt;&gt;== secondElement
    &gt;&gt;== asStringList
    &gt;&gt;== asPages
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this reads very nicely, even nicer than the method version (though we
can still improve it). Each line says &ldquo;as long as it hasn&rsquo;t failed, transform
with&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Using operators like this can be dangerous. It&rsquo;s easy to wind up with obscure
symbol soup. The key is finding a small number of highly reusable operators that
are used consistently. There&rsquo;s a cost to forcing people to learn and memorize
your operator; make sure it&rsquo;s going to be used often enough to be worth it.</p>

<p>That said, we all use operators every day, and they&rsquo;re an important part of
programming. There is no difference between <code>+</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;==</code> other than you
learned one when you were a child. <code>+</code> is nothing more than an infix function:</p>

<pre><code>infix operator + { associativity left precedence 140 }
func +(lhs: Float, rhs: Float) -&gt; Float
func +(lhs: Int, rhs: Int) -&gt; Int
...
</code></pre>

<p>We could just as well use a function called <code>add()</code> to do the same thing, but
instead everyone memorizes this arbitrary symbol because it&rsquo;s easier to use.
That&rsquo;s important. There is nothing more <em>meaningful</em> about <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>*</code>
versus <code>&gt;&gt;==</code>. They&rsquo;re just symbols you&rsquo;ve memorized. I&rsquo;m suggesting you should
memorize one more. Well, several. But you&rsquo;ll learn them over time just as you
learned <code>√</code>, <code>∫</code>, <code>∑</code>, and <code>∞</code> later than you learned <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go crazy with operators. In fact, I generally
suggest you avoid creating new ones until you&rsquo;ve thought quite a lot about it
and looked into how other languages solve similar problems. But as we go along,
I&rsquo;m going to introduce several general-purpose operators that will make your
code clearer and easier to write when used appropriately.</p>

<h2>A rose by any other name would be confusing</h2>

<p>You might ask now what this function should be called. We started by calling it
<code>continueWith</code>, but then it changed to <code>flatMap</code>, and then to <code>&gt;&gt;==</code>. I didn&rsquo;t
mention it here, but it&rsquo;s also called <code>Bind</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>. Other Swift developers
have called it
<a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/efficient-json-in-swift-with-functional-concepts-and-generics">>>></a>
and <a href="http://nomothetis.svbtle.com/the-culmination-i">>>=-</a>. Its math name is a
monadic bind. But what should we call it?</p>

<p>I believe Swift programmers should call the function <code>flatMap</code> (as in Scala) and
should use <code>&gt;&gt;==</code> as the operator (derived from Haskell). The operator should be
pronounced &ldquo;bind&rdquo; or colloquially &ldquo;and then.&rdquo; <code>bind()</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> are existing
functions in Swift, and it&rsquo;s dangerous to overload things with completely
different meanings (I&rsquo;m looking at you, C++ <code>&lt;&lt;</code>). I think the operator should
preserve as much of the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; as possible from Haskell&rsquo;s, and I think <code>&gt;&gt;==</code>
does that best.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='spend time looking at how other
languages and other Swift developers have approached the same problem.'></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not really important, though. It&rsquo;s just my suggestion, and others might
reasonably disagree. The point is that before foisting a new operator on the
world (or even your team), you should spend time looking at how other
languages and other Swift developers have approached the same problem.
Otherwise you cut yourself off from a lot of insight and you make it hard for
others coming to your code. Maybe they won&rsquo;t know Haskell or F# or Scala, but
maybe they will. They definitely won&rsquo;t know the operator you made up over lunch.
Make sure it&rsquo;s valuable enough to be worth teaching them.</p>

<p></span></p>

<h2>Maps flat, maybe brains too</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, you&rsquo;ve come a long way. It&rsquo;s a lot to take in. Let me
sum up where we are in our parser:</p>

<pre><code>func pagesFromData(data: NSData) -&gt; Result&lt;[Page]&gt; {
  return asJSON(data)
    &gt;&gt;== asJSONArray
    &gt;&gt;== secondElement
    &gt;&gt;== asStringList
    &gt;&gt;== asPages
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Given some data, convert it to JSON and then to a JSON array and then take the
second element and then convert that to a string list and then convert those to
a list of pages and return the result.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that captures our algorithm about as clearly as we can. Compare it to
the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rnapier/9e8f92a1ce6be5c3d295">original version</a>. It
handles errors without littering our code with error handling or requiring
exceptions. It&rsquo;s compact, but not dense. It&rsquo;s easy to modify or extend. And each
of the individual functions is about as simple as it could be and easy to unit
test (or so simple that it literally can&rsquo;t be wrong). There&rsquo;s still more work to
make it generic. Things like <code>secondElement</code> obviously don&rsquo;t scale, and we&rsquo;ll
work on that in future posts. But the basic structure is quite nice I think.</p>

<p>Until then, here are some take-aways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swift makes it easier to chain together methods than functions</li>
<li>&hellip;but methods are harder to reason about because of <code>self</code></li>
<li>Generic operators like <code>&gt;&gt;==</code> make it easy to chain together functions that peal away a small part of the problem while maintaining structure like error handling</li>
<li>&hellip;but new operators should be created with caution, founded in the lessons of history</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s enough for this time. This was a major turning point, but there are still
a lot of things to cover. Until then, stop mutating. Evolve.</p>

<p>In a later post we&rsquo;ll discuss how <code>flatten</code> is insanely simple to implement with <code>reduce</code>.
