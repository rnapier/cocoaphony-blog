<div class="entry-content"><p><em>From a posting on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1514102/how-to-become-a-security-domain-expert/1514199#1514199">StackOverflow</a>.</em></p>

<p>There are many areas of security expertise, so it highly depends on what your want your career path to look like. At the bits-and-bytes end there is penetration testing and &ldquo;security research&rdquo; (which is often as much &ldquo;cataloging of programming bugs&rdquo; as actual research). At the more strategic end there is &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; which often spends much of its time in non-technical considerations like appropriate budgets, education and response.</p>

<p>Blah, blah, blah, but how do you get started, right?<!-- more --> Perhaps the best writer on the subject &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; security is <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html">Bruce Schneier</a>. He&rsquo;s a cryptographer, but he focuses on things like the psychology of security, social attacks, and how to really think about security. Crypto-Gram is required reading for how to think correctly in this space.</p>

<p>In the bit-and-bytes areas, you probably want to figure out what area you&rsquo;re most interested in digging into (Windows, wireless, web, physical, iPhone, the list goes on and on). If I had to pick a single paper, though, I&rsquo;d start with <a href="http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html">Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit</a>. It is still, all these years later, the best introduction to a key class of attack and how technical attacks work in general. If these kinds of attacks are what really interest you, my favorite book on the subject is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/0764544683">Shellcoder&rsquo;s Handbook</a>. Its attacks are old; many of them won&rsquo;t even work anymore as-is. But they&rsquo;re the basis of how many attacks are still done today.</p>

<p>If you want to move up the &ldquo;value chain&rdquo; into &ldquo;business-centric security&rdquo; (and learn to use phrases like that without quotation marks), you should begin work on a <a href="http://www.isc2.org/">CISSP</a>. People can debate till their blue in the face over whether a CISSP actually means anything. The answer is: it means getting the job when CISSP is a requirement. My feelings on the CISSP? Any real security professional should be able to pass it. As such, it is a good <em>baseline</em> certification for whether you a real security professional, which is what it&rsquo;s meant to be) It teaches the common terminology that has grown up in the security world, and learning the terminology is part of being a professional (just like in any other profession from law to engineering). The CISSP is very broad, and studying for it will give you a much better idea of what areas interest you, even if you don&rsquo;t ever sit for the test. There are tons of books on CISSP; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Certification-All-Guide-Fourth/dp/0071497870/ref=dp_cp_ob_b_title_0">All-in-One</a> is fine. Reading this tome will not make you a security expert, but it&rsquo;ll introduce you to what security professionals know.</p>

<p>My background is in risk assessment. For years I traveled to companies, evaluated their environments, and told them what to fix in order to protect their most sensitive information. Probably the most useful training I had for that was the <a href="http://www.securityhorizon.com/">IAM</a> (the NSA&rsquo;s Infosec Assessment Methodology). It&rsquo;s getting revamped right now into the new ISAM. It focuses on figuring out what pieces of an infrastructure actually matter, and then protecting those. The most important security tool I used: Powerpoint, to make pretty slides that made it clear to the client what they needed to understand and implement. And a decent suit. Understanding this stuff is one thing. You need have very strong technical skills; that&rsquo;s a given. But actually making a <em>difference</em> takes a lot of people skills, presentation skills, project management and follow-through. It&rsquo;s what separates the &lsquo;l33t from the professionals.</p>

<p><em>Followup Exercise</em> If you&rsquo;re interested in the wireless security domain, here&rsquo;s your first project: Set up a WEP-encrypted network and learn how to break into it. First, find the script-kiddie tools that will do it for you (they&rsquo;re easily found with google); then figure out how the tools do what they do, and then research why those attacks don&rsquo;t work on WPA. When you&rsquo;re done you&rsquo;ll have a background in the tools of the trade, but also a much better understanding of what&rsquo;s easy and what&rsquo;s hard, and what &ldquo;WEP is broken&rdquo; really means for a given network. Are their times that WEP might be acceptable? Why or why not?</p>
