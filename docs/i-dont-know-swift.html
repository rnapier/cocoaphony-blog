<div class="entry-content"><p>I know a thing or two about Objective-C. It&rsquo;s not bragging. If you&rsquo;re reading my
blog, there&rsquo;s a decent chance that I know more about Objective-C than you do. I
have opinions about it. You should take them seriously even if you disagree.
They&rsquo;re founded on shipping a lot of code. I&rsquo;ve shipped Cocoa software solo and
in big teams, OS X and iOS, year-long release cycles and 30 hours to build a
demo for Steve Jobs. I&rsquo;ve been writing ObjC since 10.4 was the new hotness,
before ARC, before properties, before Intel. There are many developers with much
more experience, but even so, I know a thing or two about Objective-C.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to write Swift.</p>

<p>Neither does anyone else.</p>

<p>Not even Apple.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Nobody knows Swift because it isn&rsquo;t baked yet. It&rsquo;s early days. We&rsquo;re all still
figuring it out. There are no established patterns. The syntax is still
changing. The stdlib is still changing. We know even more big changes are on the
horizon.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Writing the compiler isn&rsquo;t the same as shipping an app. Some
things take real-world experience, and no one has that.</p>

<p>Tim Burks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> wrote a <a href="http://www.openradar.me/17628154">provocative radar</a>
recently:</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;I&rsquo;d like to suggest that the appropriate way to introduce a new language is
for its creators to spend several months writing nontrivial applications in the
language and reviewing the results with experts. This does not seem to have been
done.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s often done. People with language design experience work on a new
language, mostly in secret or obscurity. They release it to some people, maybe
internally. A small community starts to form. These are the insiders, the first
adopters. They try things. They tinker. They build bigger things. They at least
build some large libraries (Go&rsquo;s stdlib, parts of .NET for C#). They revise the
languge based on what they learn. More people come. Maybe it becomes public or
maybe it just gains some &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; and new, uninitiated people start to
use it for more serious things and maybe it even becomes &ldquo;important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swift has come naked into the world. Half-baked. Some parts ill-considered and
changing dramatically before our eyes. Most of its libraries are still in ObjC,
C, and C++. It&rsquo;s just the beginning and you&rsquo;re all here. You&rsquo;re those early
adopters, usually that tiny, almost hand-picked group. But there are thousands
of you this time, here in the primordial era.</p>

<p>You can think this is good or bad, but it&rsquo;s definitely a special opportunity. I
predict with great confidence that Swift will be
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE&rsquo;s</a>
language of the year. It entered the list at #16 and it isn&rsquo;t even released yet.
And here you are. Not just on the ground floor, but standing on the newly poured
foundation. It seems pretty solid, but it&rsquo;s not a building quite yet.</p>

<p>Imagine if Google had said &ldquo;Go is the future for Android development&rdquo; or
Microsoft had recommended all C# developers move to F#. Apple has made Swift the
preferred language for one of the most popular platforms in existance. I expect
they&rsquo;ll follow through with that.
<a href="http://robnapier.net/week-of-swift/">&ldquo;Any evaluation of Swift starts and ends with how well it lets developers build really fantastic iOS and Mac apps.&rdquo;</a>
I believe Swift meets that criteria even better than ObjC (and I love ObjC). I
don&rsquo;t see any reason Apple would back away from Swift now.</p>

<p>So there you go. You&rsquo;re here at the beginning. There is no priesthood. There are
no old folks sitting on rocking chairs cussing your new-fangled dot-syntax. You
are the old folks. You remember before immutable arrays.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re a day-zero Swift expert, and if you&rsquo;re not, you could be a year-zero
Swift expert even if you wait for iOS 8 to ship. The niches are all still open.
Read everything.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Write <a href="https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz">something</a>.
Get involved. Try out new patterns, see if they work. Tell people what you
discover.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>And most of all, if things in Swift bother you, if they don&rsquo;t work for you, if
they could be better, say it now. Open radars.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Post on devforum. Write
an example. Show why your way makes the code better. Swift is still changing,
and it&rsquo;s in beta exactly so it can change. It may be a long time before you
have this chance again.</p>

<p>Can you say access controls? We know they&rsquo;re coming. We don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll look like.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>&hellip;whose opinions I take quite seriously. He&rsquo;s a smart, insightful guy. <a href="http://programming.nu">Nu</a> is an interesting language. I even agree with some of his frustrations about Swift. <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaphony/status/487331425369063424">We just disagree on what to do about them.</a><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>BTW, my current favorite Swift blogs are <a href="http://airspeedvelocity.net">Airspeed Velocity</a> and <a href="http://nomothetis.svbtle.com">nomothetis (Alexandros Salazar)</a>. Highly recommended. They&rsquo;re teaching me a lot. I&rsquo;d love to see more people writing this way.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve found that <code>if let x = x { ... }</code> (rebinding to the same identifier) is a pretty good style for unloading an optional. I&rsquo;ve also found that <code>map()</code> on an optional can be a handy replacement for <code>if-let</code> when you can&rsquo;t use chaining. For example: <code>let optY = optX.map{Y(x:$0)}</code>. An extension on <code>Optional</code> to wrap <code>map</code> in a function called <code>ifSet</code> can make this a little easier to read.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>Yes, radar stinks; do it anyway, it&rsquo;s not that bad. And from the forums, the Swift team is clearly reading and reacting to the radars they receive.<a href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
