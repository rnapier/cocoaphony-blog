<div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s a lazy day for me. That means I&rsquo;ll probably hack stuff all day.</p>

<p>One of my best friends in the world just sent me a note asking for a good Cocoa reference. I thought I&rsquo;d pass on the same advice I gave him:</p>

<p>This is <strong>the</strong> book on learning Cocoa:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503619?ie=UTF8&tag=cocoaphony-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=cocoaphony-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321503619" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Aaron Hillegass</p>

<p>Third edition is supposed to come out this summer. I&rsquo;ve read the proofs of the 3rd edition, and it does add some good stuff, but if you&rsquo;re anxious to get started, I&rsquo;d get 2nd edition and get started.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I may sound like a terrible shill for Aaron, who also happens to be a very nice guy and an excellent instructor, but this really is <strong>the</strong> book on the subject. Poll any group of Cocoa developers and it&rsquo;ll come up over and over again either as the book they used or the book they would have used if it had existed when they started.</p>

<p>Do not just sit down and read this book in bed. Get our XCode and work through the projects. Even just re-typing code out of the book will teach you a lot. You&rsquo;ll learn how to get around XCode and how Objective-C &ldquo;feels&rdquo; to type. That may sound silly, but Obj-C doesn&rsquo;t type like other languages. The method names are very long and multi-part, so using the built-in code completion is much more useful than it may be in Java or C++.
The one problem with starting with 2nd Edition is that its written for Interface Builder 2, and 10.5 moved to IB3. You have several choices: wait for 3rd edition (don&rsquo;t. get started learning this week, you&rsquo;ll thank yourself later); download XCode 2.5 from Apple and learn using that (not a bad solution); or read the IB help, particularly &ldquo;Interface Builder Workflow Tools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is the one huge secret that will make things easier moving from IB2 to IB3: If you want to instantiate a custom class, the IB2 way was to go into the class browser, find the class you wanted and select &ldquo;Instantiate&rdquo; for it. There is no class browser in IB3, so you&rsquo;ll hunt forever&hellip;. The answer is to drag an NSObject or NSView from the library onto your object window (the one with &ldquo;File&rsquo;s Owner&rdquo; in it), then go to the Identity pane of the Inspector and set the Class. This is a really unintuitive way to do a very common operation. It took me ages to figure it out with my background in IB2. Yes, it makes sense, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have to click that much to find it.</p>

<p>If you have any interest in being a Cocoa programmer, go do it. A great book is available at a reasonable price. All the same tools that the professionals use are available for free with the OS. There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from building little (but useful) Cocoa apps a month from now.</p>
