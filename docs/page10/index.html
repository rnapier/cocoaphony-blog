  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can’t take credit for finding this myself. Gilad Gurantz forwarded it to me. From the Quartz Event Services documentation:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>CGEventTimestamp</b></p>
Defines the elapsed time in nanoseconds since startup that a Quartz event occurred.

<code>typedef uint64_t CGEventTimestamp;</code>

<b>Discussion</b>
An event timestamp is a big, unsigned, 64-bit number. That's big, really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. You may think your application has been running for a long time, but that's just peanuts to an event timestamp.</blockquote>

<p>So if my math is right, “a long time” translates into over 2850 years. And it’s counted since the last reboot. I think we’ll avoid the Y2K problem on this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/build-system-1-build-panel">Part 1</a> of our series, you learned how to use basic xcconfig files to manage build configuration in Xcode rather than using the Build Panel. This is useful, but a bit tedious to set up every time you make a new project. What we need is a way to automatically create new projects that have our setup in place already. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could create new Project Templates just like the ones that come with Xcode? You can, and since the release of the iPhone version of Xcode, it’s easier than ever. Let’s make one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you worried about the trouble with PandoraBoy’s hotkeys and Applescript, I’ve finally carved out some time to work on this stuff. I keep getting hung up on the hotkeys preference pane, which can’t be opened in IB3, due to the use of the Shortcut Recorder IB Palette. The answer, I’ve always known, is just to rewrite the hotkey pref pane. It isn’t that hard, I’ve just avoided it, and it’s finally time to do it and fix a few bugs in the process.</p>

<p>Have I mentioned recently that PandoraBoy is an excellent small project to practice and hone your Cocoa skills?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>XCode has a decent build system, but it doesn’t work as well as it could out of the box. With just a little work, you can make your projects easier to setup and maintain just the way you want them, improve your code, and even speed up your build times.</p>

<p>The first thing we want to do is get rid of one of the great obfuscations of Xcode: The Build panel.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/build-system-1-build-panel/buildpanel.png" /></p>

<p>The build panel seems convenient at first, but in practice it makes it hard to see what’s going on in your build. It especially gets confusing as your build settings get complicated. When you need to turn off Thumb Code Generation because of an obscure assembler conflict in legacy C++ code (true story), it would be nice to put a comment somewhere indicating why you’ve done this so someone doesn’t come along later switch the setting. The Build Panel doesn’t give you an easy way to include comments right along with the setting (the “Comments” panel is pretty useless in my experience), and it’s easy to lose settings or accidentally apply them to only to one configuration.</p>

<p>XCode provides a better solution called xcconfig files. Everything you can do in the build panel can be done in xcconfig files, and you can actually read them and make comments. So let’s make some.

<p>In Cocoa, a delegate is an object that another object defers to on questions of behavior and informs about changes in its state. For instance, a UITableViewDelegate is responsible for answering questions about how the UITableView should behave when selections are made or rows are reordered. It is the object that the UITableView asks when it wants to know how high a particular row should be. In the Model-View-Controller paradigm, delegates are Controllers, and many delegates’ names end in “Controller.”

For readers with a prior background in Cocoa, it is likely a good book for transitioning to iPhone, particularly iPhone UI.</i></p>

<p><i>Beginning iPhone Development</i> is a pretty good book. It assumes you already have some background in ObjC, which makes it harder for people without any Cocoa experience (the most common place to get ObjC experience). A short ObjC intro would have been useful. Like other books in this space, it doesn’t provide much background in basic Foundation features like Collections and Notifications, nor key patterns like delegation, memory management and naming. As students move beyond trivial projects, they will likely start to have trouble unless they shore up these skills elsewhere.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Say you want to talk to another app through Applescript. With 10.5, you can much more easily get there from Cocoa without complex forays into CoreServices, Carbon and AppleEvents. The docs on how to do it are a little thin at times (as all Applescript docs are), so let’s walk through it. The relevant docs you’ll want to read are these:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/learn.html">Learning Applescript</a></p>

<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/ScriptingAutomation/Reference/ScriptingBridgeFramework">Scripting Bridge Framework Reference</a></p>

<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/SBSystemPrefs/index.html">Scripting Bridge Sample Code</a></p>

<p>And most importantly (and most hidden):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Summary: If you want a real understanding of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, this book is too recipe-based to give you that. If you really want recipes, consider Apple’s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/navigation/SampleCode.html">Sample Code</a>.
</em></p>

<p>I haven’t been thrilled with the first crop of iPhone development books that hit the market. This shouldn’t be surprising. It’s a new platform and, as with the first AppStore apps, the pressure to be first to market fights the authors’ desire to provide the best possible product.</p>

<p>I was specifically asked about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321555457?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cocoaphony-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321555457" rel="nofollow">iPhone Developer’s Cookbook: Building Applications with the iPhone SDK</a> by Erica Sadun. My biggest concern is that it’s a cookbook based on “recipes” to do this or that. This is often exactly the problem with how people learn Mac and iPhone development. They think that it’s just Java or C++ with a different syntax and if they learn where the brackets go, then they’ll be a Cocoa developer. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now and then I teach Mac and iPhone courses, and several people have asked me to detail my syllabus, and provide some other pointers on how to get started. I’ve taught this course in various forms, running from 3 to 10 days long. A week and a half is good; it gives you a weekend to absorb a little bit.</p>

<p>I tend to teach Mac and iPhone together, though I been focusing on iPhone because that’s what we’ve needed most. I still favor Aaron Hillegass’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503619?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cocoaphony-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=cocoaphony-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321503619" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> as a textbook. I’m open to suggestions for excellent iPhone-specific books for beginners, but when I was developing this course last August, I didn’t find a lot on the market I was impressed with. Even the Big Nerd Ranch iPhone class I found disappointing, which is one of the reasons I had to write my own class for our new developers. The Big Nerd Ranch’s Cocoa Bootcamp still cannot be beat if you’re looking to learn Mac development and have several grand handy.</p>

<p>So without further ado, the syllabus and resources. I can’t promise that reading through this will be as effective as watching me pace around for a week telling you about it, but it perhaps it will give a nice kick-start.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>See <a href="wrapping-c-take-2-1">Take 2</a> for an updated approach to this problem.</em></p>

<p>When faced with mixing C++ and ObjC code, there are two main approaches. One is to just work in Objective-C++ through the entire project. I don’t like this approach. I find the mixing of ObjC and C++ classes very confusing, since they cannot be used interchangeably and require completely different memory management. The mix of class hierarchies and naming conventions lead to a lot of confusion when we introduce people to code that does this kind of mixing.</p>

<p>My opinion is that ObjC and C++ have very different patterns, so it is important to pick one to be in charge and wrap the other. So if you basically have an C++ program than needs a little ObjC to talk to the UI, then wrap the ObjC in C++ objects. If you basically have an ObjC program that needs a C++ middleware, then wrap the C++ objects.</div>
