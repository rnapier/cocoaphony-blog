  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you familiar with SQL and coming to Core Data, you probably want to separate the concept of &ldquo;database&rdquo; into the two kinds we&rsquo;re discussing here. There are relational databases, which is what you&rsquo;re probably used to, and object databases, which is what Core Data provides. Core Data happens to implement its object database on top of a relational database (SQLite), but that is a opaque implementation detail.</p>

<p>In a relational database, the key actions are the select and the transaction. In the select, you ask the database to form itself into a collection of columns (joins are just a fancy way of doing that), filter and sort itself according to some set of rules, and then return you a linear collection of rows. In the transaction, you inform the system that you are beginning a transaction, instruct the database to perform a series of transformations, and then commit or roll-back the transaction. It&rsquo;s a great model, but Core Data doesn&rsquo;t look much like it.</div>

<p>The trouble with the &ldquo;break it into tiny pieces&rdquo; approach is that the number of pieces quickly explodes so large that the act of tracking them swamps the project.

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Unregistering</h3>


<p>Because these bugs are very hard to track down and very easy to avoid, I&rsquo;d like to direct everyone&rsquo;s attention to how to properly unregister for notifications.</p>

<p>If your object uses NSNotificationCenter ever, you must add the following to -dealloc:</p>

<pre lang="objc">[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];</pre>


<p>This removes you from all notifications. If you fail to do this, and you are dealloc'ed, and a notification you were observing is later posted, the application will crash with a bizarre access violation deep in NSNotificationCenter when it tries to post to an object (you) which no longer exists. It is tricky to figure out even what notification is being passed in these cases.</p>

<p>If you are not observing anything, then -removeObserver: does nothing, so it is not dangerous to call. There is a slight performance cost, especially for objects that are alloc'ed and dealloc'ed a lot, so there&rsquo;s no reason to add it to objects that do nothing with notifications, but I recommend better safe than sorry in most cases.</p>

<p>This advice does not apply to KVO observations, which are a completely different animal. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When faced with the need to return &ldquo;not found&rdquo; for something that normally returns an index or other value that would normally be unsigned (whether this is an error condition or a normal event), Cocoa offers the NSNotFound constant as an alternative to returning an illegal index like -1 (which forces you to change the index to an NSInteger, raising the likelihood of sign-based errors if there&rsquo;s ever a long promotion).</p>

<p>NSNotFound is 0x7fffffff, which is not -1 (0xffffffff), but is still very large  (~2 billion) and so should never be a real index for any sanely-sized spaces, and is more readable than -1. NSNotFound is a good constant to remember when these issues come up. Look at NSString -rangeOfString: for an example of its usage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="post-body entry-content">I'm back into PandoraBoy development. Looks like Pandora changed something with their last UI update, and it's broken PB and maybe also Pandora.FM (who uses the same API as we do). We're just not getting events anymore from the API. So I've dropped a note to their support list and we'll see if they can help us out at all. This is why Growl is broken; Pandora doesn't know when tracks change.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I move between VS and XCode a bit without shuddering or fussing, which seems to make me a strange creature. In general, shocking as it is to say on a Cocoa list, VS is actually a much more powerful environment. Most who love XCode have little used VS (at least VS2005 or later,Â <a href="http://vs.net/" target="_blank">VS.NET</a> is clunky IMO). But learning what actually is better about VS requires using XCode for quite some time. Most of the initial complaints are simply small differences between the two; many of which I prefer the XCode way. But then, XCode is a Mac app, and I generally prefer Mac UI.</p>
