  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ll talk more about it later, but the absolute best way to learn iPhone is to learn Mac first. That’s how I teach my classes. The available Mac educational resources are just much better, at least today.</p>

<p>The absolute gold standard for learning Cocoa on Mac is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503619?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cocoaphony-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=cocoaphony-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321503619" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 by Aaron Hillegass. It is <em>the</em> book. I have a syllabus based on it that’s stripped down to the chapters that are useful for iPhone programmers. I’ll get that into a blog post.</p>

<p>When I teach this, it runs between 5 and 10 full days depending on how in-depth I cover the Mac side.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple <em>finally </em>updated the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmNibObjects.html">Memory Management Guide</a> to deal with IBOutlets.</p>

<p>They came to the same recommendation that many of us have. Treat them exactly like other properties. Mark them as retain properties, release them in -dealloc, and overload -setView to clear them in low-memory situations. This last recommendation was one that many of us used, but was based on undocumented behaviors. Apple finally documented the behavior because there’s no other good way to do it given their internal implementation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they haven’t updated the “Using View Controllers” documentation to include this stuff, and the section on how -loadView works is still a bit vague. I’ve sent them feedback on those pages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you familiar with SQL and coming to Core Data, you probably want to separate the concept of “database” into the two kinds we’re discussing here. There are relational databases, which is what you’re probably used to, and object databases, which is what Core Data provides. Core Data happens to implement its object database on top of a relational database (SQLite), but that is a opaque implementation detail.</p>

<p>In a relational database, the key actions are the select and the transaction. In the select, you ask the database to form itself into a collection of columns (joins are just a fancy way of doing that), filter and sort itself according to some set of rules, and then return you a linear collection of rows. In the transaction, you inform the system that you are beginning a transaction, instruct the database to perform a series of transformations, and then commit or roll-back the transaction. It’s a great model, but Core Data doesn’t look much like it.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joel Spolsky, of <a><em>Joel on Software</em></a> is one of my favorite writers in the software industry. He’s insightful, pithy, and practical. But sometimes he and I part ways, at least in practice, and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html">“Evidence Based Scheduling”</a> is one of those times.</p>

<p>The trouble with the “break it into tiny pieces” approach is that the number of pieces quickly explodes so large that the act of tracking them swamps the project. And now, rather than getting wildly behind schedule because you underestimated how long a particular piece will take, you’re behind schedule because you underestimated how many pieces there were. And now you have more project management overhead…. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are the three magic words: +alloc, -copy and +new. If you commit these magic words to memory, and devote yourself to a life of accessors, then Cocoa memory management should cause you no fear.</p>

<p>For those interested in the path to memory management enlightenment, you should first deeply understand every word of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html" target="_blank">Memory Management Rules</a>. Don’t be afraid, it is very short, and if you will commit it to heart, you will avoid much suffering in the future. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Unregistering</h3>
<p>Because these bugs are very hard to track down and very easy to avoid, I’d like to direct everyone’s attention to how to properly unregister for notifications.</p>

<p>If your object uses NSNotificationCenter ever, you must add the following to -dealloc:</p>

<pre lang="objc">[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];</pre>

<p>This removes you from all notifications. If you fail to do this, and you are dealloc’ed, and a notification you were observing is later posted, the application will crash with a bizarre access violation deep in NSNotificationCenter when it tries to post to an object (you) which no longer exists. It is tricky to figure out even what notification is being passed in these cases.</p>

<p>If you are not observing anything, then -removeObserver: does nothing, so it is not dangerous to call. There is a slight performance cost, especially for objects that are alloc’ed and dealloc’ed a lot, so there’s no reason to add it to objects that do nothing with notifications, but I recommend better safe than sorry in most cases.</p>

<p>This advice does not apply to KVO observations, which are a completely different animal. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When faced with the need to return “not found” for something that normally returns an index or other value that would normally be unsigned (whether this is an error condition or a normal event), Cocoa offers the NSNotFound constant as an alternative to returning an illegal index like -1 (which forces you to change the index to an NSInteger, raising the likelihood of sign-based errors if there’s ever a long promotion).</p>

<p>NSNotFound is 0x7fffffff, which is not -1 (0xffffffff), but is still very large  (~2 billion) and so should never be a real index for any sanely-sized spaces, and is more readable than -1. NSNotFound is a good constant to remember when these issues come up. Look at NSString -rangeOfString: for an example of its usage.</p>
