  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are the three magic words: +alloc, -copy and +new. If you commit these magic words to memory, and devote yourself to a life of accessors, then Cocoa memory management should cause you no fear.</p>

<p>For those interested in the path to memory management enlightenment, you should first deeply understand every word of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html" target="_blank">Memory Management Rules</a>. Don’t be afraid, it is very short, and if you will commit it to heart, you will avoid much suffering in the future. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Unregistering</h3>
<p>Because these bugs are very hard to track down and very easy to avoid, I’d like to direct everyone’s attention to how to properly unregister for notifications.</p>

<p>If your object uses NSNotificationCenter ever, you must add the following to -dealloc:</p>

<pre lang="objc">[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];</pre>

<p>This removes you from all notifications. If you fail to do this, and you are dealloc’ed, and a notification you were observing is later posted, the application will crash with a bizarre access violation deep in NSNotificationCenter when it tries to post to an object (you) which no longer exists. It is tricky to figure out even what notification is being passed in these cases.</p>

<p>If you are not observing anything, then -removeObserver: does nothing, so it is not dangerous to call. There is a slight performance cost, especially for objects that are alloc’ed and dealloc’ed a lot, so there’s no reason to add it to objects that do nothing with notifications, but I recommend better safe than sorry in most cases.</p>

<p>This advice does not apply to KVO observations, which are a completely different animal. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When faced with the need to return “not found” for something that normally returns an index or other value that would normally be unsigned (whether this is an error condition or a normal event), Cocoa offers the NSNotFound constant as an alternative to returning an illegal index like -1 (which forces you to change the index to an NSInteger, raising the likelihood of sign-based errors if there’s ever a long promotion).</p>

<p>NSNotFound is 0x7fffffff, which is not -1 (0xffffffff), but is still very large  (~2 billion) and so should never be a real index for any sanely-sized spaces, and is more readable than -1. NSNotFound is a good constant to remember when these issues come up. Look at NSString -rangeOfString: for an example of its usage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="post-body entry-content">I'm back into PandoraBoy development. Looks like Pandora changed something with their last UI update, and it's broken PB and maybe also Pandora.FM (who uses the same API as we do). We're just not getting events anymore from the API. So I've dropped a note to their support list and we'll see if they can help us out at all. This is why Growl is broken; Pandora doesn't know when tracks change.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I move between VS and XCode a bit without shuddering or fussing, which seems to make me a strange creature. In general, shocking as it is to say on a Cocoa list, VS is actually a much more powerful environment. Most who love XCode have little used VS (at least VS2005 or later, <a href="http://vs.net/" target="_blank">VS.NET</a> is clunky IMO). But learning what actually is better about VS requires using XCode for quite some time. Most of the initial complaints are simply small differences between the two; many of which I prefer the XCode way. But then, XCode is a Mac app, and I generally prefer Mac UI.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A fie on useless attempts to stop hacking… At least that’s my current assumption on why Microsoft did this. I’m a Cocoa guy, but I actually like .NET and hack a bit of it now and then. It’s a pretty good framework, though you can see some of the seams where Microsoft didn’t quite think it through when they were designing it and had to tack on later (the whole System.Text.Encoding namespace that’s made up of methods that should exist on String; but then C# doesn’t have ObjC-style categories so they probably also being more careful about throwing 10k methods on a single class the way Cocoa does, but I’m running off on a tangent here).</p>

<p>The point today is the headache that is the HttpWebRequest.Date property. What HttpWebRequest.Date property you might ask? That’s right; there isn’t one. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a busy few weeks for PandoraBoy… well, for PandoraBoy’s mailbox. I’ve been incredibly busy getting my day-to-day work out for months now and have barely looked at PandoraBoy since about February. The backlog of Issues has grown to a troubling level, and it’s probably another few weeks before I’ll be able to get back into PB development. But in the meantime I’ve been amazed at how much mail I’ve been getting on the subject. Mostly small bugs people are running into, but then, this just in:</p>

<p>PandoraBoy in French. Yes, Pierre Rudloff, out of the blue, sends me a fully translated lproj. I really appreciate it. I’ll make sure to get it integrated into the next release. I probably won’t get started on PB development until after WWDC because of other projects, but after WWDC it’s top of my list. Especially all the annoying little bugs that have been creeping in (I suspect because of some backend Pandora changes).</p>

<p>I recently read a comment about this hack wondering how long the author had sat on the exploit rather than reporting it to Apple. It’s a very important point.</p>

<p>My opinion of these “security researchers” is well known: there’s a difference between bird watching and research. Finding yet another buffer overflow isn’t “research.” Creating a new way to secure systems is research. Coming up with whole new classes of attack might be research (along the lines of bioweapon research). Those who hunt new instances of old bugs are collectors of exotic animals, weapon manufacturers, volunteer quality testers, or a half-dozen other categories that have little to do with science or research.</div>

I was incredibly skeptical from the headline. It read to me like “team builds near-useless browser that is probably a bit harder to hack than an unpatched Windows box.” But it’s actually an interesting architecture. I like their early consideration of plugin issue. Rather than banning plugins, sandboxing them till they can’t do anything, or bemoaning that plugin writers will probably be stupid and break security but it won’t be the browser’s fault, these guys actually seem to have considered how to compartmentalize such that the plugin can be compromised without losing the farm. That’s a good security lesson for us all. It’s not about making sure nothing bad ever happens or banning everything that could ever let something bad happen. It’s about making sure that when bad things do happen (and they will), that the damage is contained to the piece that was compromised. And to this feature, wow:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>The UIUI team has also designed a browser-level information-flow tracking system to enable post-mortem analysis of browser-based attacks.</blockquote>
<p>That’s a team that “gets it.” You will get hacked. Designing for what you do <em>after</em> you get hacked is a sign of great security thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>
