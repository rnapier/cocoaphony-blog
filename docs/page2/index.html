  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a speaker, writer, and member of our community, <a href="http://dimsumthinking.com">Daniel Steinberg</a> is my inspiration. That&rsquo;s not a secret. If you and I have spent much time talking after a conference, I&rsquo;ve probably mentioned it. It&rsquo;s not the sort of thing you usually say to someone, and I don&rsquo;t think I ever have, but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from his speaking style, and I constantly try to live up to his standard of kindness. I&rsquo;m not by nature very kind, so if you see me behaving that way, I&rsquo;m likely trying to do what I think Daniel might.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say we&rsquo;re close. We see each other at conferences. We email and tweet. We&rsquo;re members of a community. So of course I have some idealized picture of him in my mind, without all the this and that of a real person. Even so, he inspires me. When my wife, Janet, and I talk about what&rsquo;s ahead for our future, we always talk about Daniel and his wife, Kim. I&rsquo;ve seen them at conferences, traveling together, independent but a team, and I think, hey, we could pull that off when the kids go to school. And Janet and I talk about how to make that work. And we know we only have the shallowest understanding of their real lives, but they inspire us.</p>

<p>Kim died this week. I didn&rsquo;t know her well. We&rsquo;d met, and she was nice to me. She and Daniel always seemed so &ldquo;together&rdquo; even when they were apart most of the day. Hearing the news unmoored me and scared me and made me think about myself and my family and my plans. And then my heart broke for Daniel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not kind by nature. But I&rsquo;m part of a community that is, and part of that is Daniel&rsquo;s influence on us. <a href="https://twitter.com/designatednerd">Ellen Shapiro</a> has been kind and <a href="http://support.smiletrain.org/site/RedirectHandler?type=goto&amp;key=ios-for-kim">set up a fund</a> to let us support SmileTrain, where Daniel and his daughter Maggie have asked us to give in Kim&rsquo;s name. I had never heard of SmileTrain, but it is so perfect. It is kind. And it is practical. It is literally the gift of a smile. It is Daniel and Kim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been learning the guitar for a little less than a year now. My hope some day is to be a mediocre guitar player. With practice, I think I can get there, but I&rsquo;m not there yet. Even so, I went to a guitar jam last week. It was my first time ever playing with other people. One of the guys loaned me a capo since I&rsquo;d forgotten mine. They showed me chords I didn&rsquo;t know. They pushed me to lead a song, and they made a great effort to follow my ever-changing tempo and shaking voice. By the end of the three hours, I could barely even strum, but I&rsquo;d had a fantastic time. The group encouraged me to come back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Or&hellip; &ldquo;How I learned to stop worrying, and love Foundation.&rdquo;</h2>

<blockquote><p>Forgive me, NSData. I was running around with that flashy [UInt8], acting like you didn&rsquo;t have everything I need. I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson.</p>

<p>&mdash; Rob Napier (@cocoaphony) <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaphony/status/648514927678910464">September 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I did a lot of writing and rewriting of the <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor/releases/tag/RNCryptor-4.0.0-beta.1">Swift version of RNCryptor</a>. I struggled especially with what type to use for data. I gravitated quickly to <code>[UInt8]</code> with all its apparent Swiftiness. But in the end, after many iterations, I refactored back to <code>NSData</code>, and I&rsquo;m really glad I did.</p>

<p>This is the story of why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When <a href="http://robnapier.net/erasure">last we talked about type erasure</a>, I described an easy way to build type erasures using closures. And I mentioned:</p>

<blockquote><p>(While this works exactly like AnySequence, this isn’t how AnySequence is implemented. In my next post I’ll discuss why and how to implement type erasers like stdlib does.)</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time I thought I&rsquo;d pretty well nailed it down, but every time I dug into it I found another little thing I&rsquo;d missed, and it never seemed to end. And with stdlib open sourcing soon, you&rsquo;ll all just be able to read this yourselves, so why embarrass myself getting it all wrong? Over time I kind of hoped you all had forgotten that comment and planned to move on to other things. But then I was <a href="https://twitter.com/My_kl/status/650796108789219328">busted by Michael Welch</a>, and so I had to finish the spelunking and here you go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After months of writing and rewriting, I am happy to finally announce <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor/releases/tag/RNCryptor-4.0.0-beta.1">RNCryptor 4 beta 1</a> in Swift.</p>

<p>RNCryptor 4 is a complete rewrite of RNCryptor for Swift 2 with full bridging support to Objective-C. It has a streamlined API, simpler installation, and improved internals. It continues to use the <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-Spec/blob/master/RNCryptor-Spec-v3.md">v3 data format</a> and is fully interoperable with <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor">other RNCryptor implementations</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time, when Swift was young, there were a couple of types called <code>SequenceOf</code> and <code>GeneratorOf</code>, and they could type erase stuff. &ldquo;Type erase?&rdquo; you may ask. &ldquo;I thought we <em>loved</em> types.&rdquo; We do. Don&rsquo;t worry. Our types aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. But sometimes we want them to be a little less&hellip;precise.</p>

<p>In Swift 2, our little type erasers got a rename and some friends. Now they&rsquo;re all named &ldquo;Any&rdquo;-something. So <code>SequenceOf</code> became <code>AnySequence</code> and <code>GeneratorOf</code> became <code>AnyGenerator</code> and there are a gaggle of indexes and collections from <code>AnyForwardIndex</code> to <code>AnyRandomAccessCollection</code>.</p>

<p>So what are these type erasers? Let&rsquo;s start with how to use one and we&rsquo;ll work backwards to why.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Forgive a slight divergence. I&rsquo;ll bring it back to software development before the end.</p>

<p>A friend of mine is an arborist. He takes care of a large forest, trimming and culling trees. He&rsquo;s quite good at it and enjoys it, but he&rsquo;s worried about job security. He thinks cabinet making would be a good career move. He likes to work with wood, and high-end cabinets are very expensive so there&rsquo;s clearly a lot of money there. I&rsquo;m a hobbyist woodworker, so we were talking about it.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/throw-what-dont-throw">Last time</a> we talked about how a function that can
throw errors is a different type in Swift than a function that cannot throw
errors. And then I briefly mentioned this other thing, &ldquo;rethrows.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s talk
about that, and along the way explore closure types a little more and their
weird and woolly ways. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So say you are trying out all this interesting new <code>throw</code> stuff in Swift 2. And
say you&rsquo;re running an early Beta in which many stdlib functions don&rsquo;t handle
throw closures yet. Or maybe you&rsquo;re in the future and dealing with some other
piece of code that you wish could handle a throw closure, but doesn&rsquo;t. What do
you do?</p>
