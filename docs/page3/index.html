throw errors is a different type in Swift than a function that cannot throw

weird and woolly ways. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So say you are trying out all this interesting new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code> stuff in Swift 2. And
say you’re running an early Beta in which many stdlib functions don’t handle
throw closures yet. Or maybe you’re in the future and dealing with some other
piece of code that you wish could handle a throw closure, but doesn’t. What do
you do?

  <p>By not using standard FP terminology in emerging languages like Swift, we deny learners access to a lot of existing literature.</p>

<p>I certainly agree. But there’s a lot more to it, and I hope the functional programming community will get involved in new ways. We’ll get there. First, a little history for the rest of us. FP folks, I’ll get back to you in a couple of sections.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://al3x.net/about.html">Alex Payne</a> wrote an excellent essay called <a href="https://al3x.net/2014/09/16/thoughts-on-five-years-of-emerging-languages.html">Thoughts on Five Years of Emerging Languages</a>. It called to mind something I wrote a while ago for a limited audience that I never got around to turning into a public form. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/TacticalGrace">Manuel Chakravarty</a> for the link and the inspiration.</p>

<p>For those who read my blog for Cocoa (and recently Swift) discussion, you may be surprised that most of my professional work right now is in Go, C, and C++ (in that order). So I thought I might take a moment to discuss Go.</p>

<p>First, it’s important to say that I really like Go. I didn’t think I would. I’m a language snob at heart. Before Swift, I’d been spending a lot of time on the <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">functional</a> side of the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">street</a> with a brief dallience with <a href="http://akka.io">actors</a>. I was just about to do deeper <a href="http://clojure.org">into the parens</a>, when I wound up taking a side trip into Google-land and Go. I’d dipped my toe into the water once before and been turned off by what seemed to be the sloppiness of the language. How variables are declared bugged me (turns out it <a href="http://gophercon.sourcegraph.com/post/83845316771/panel-discussion-with-go-team-members">bugs the lead language designer</a>, too). The multiple return types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">range</code> bugged me. <a href="http://blog.golang.org/strings">Strings switching between code points and bytes</a> bugged me. The fact that Go can’t implement its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append()</code> harkened back to funky Perl magic. Go just seemed sloppy and under-considered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our last <a href="/flatmap">talk about »==</a> was full of twists and turns, some
philosophy, surprising connections, and a radical new operator. It was a lot to
absorb, and you may have to play with it some in your own code before you really
know what it’s about. That’s ok.</p>

<p>Let’s take a little break and talk about a handy functional tool built into
Swift stdlib. I promise no big reveals, no new operators, no fancy types; just
hands-on, practical discussion of the Swiss Army knife of transform functions:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reduce</code>.</p>

<p>And I tossed a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>, unexplained, in the middle of the parsing code. I
got a little ahead of myself there. Sorry about that. Cocoa has no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>. Maybe
not everyone coming to Swift has a long history with this amazing little
function. In a field where monads get all the press, it’s time to step back and
talk about the humble map.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, this is another of those “how to parse JSON in Swift” blog posts that seem
to be required of every Swift blogger. And yes, several of the techniques we’ll
work through come from the functional programming world. And, <em>yes</em>,
Swift+Functional+JSON is itself a well-worn trail. But still, I hope you find
this exploration helpful. Don’t think of it as functional programming. Think of
it as the path of “I wish there were a function that….”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>...and I hated calculus.</p>

<p>Yes, the functional world seems to overflow with bizarre terms that defy
intuition. Faced with words like <em>object</em>, <em>property</em>, <em>inherit</em>, <em>class</em>, even 
non-programmers can get some handle on what they might mean. <em>Applicative
functor</em> is not so kind. Nor is the ubiquitous <em>monad</em>, a word that feels
designed to obscure its meaning (plus the ensuing 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2009-January/053317.html">arguments over whether something is really a monad or a monoid</a>).</p>

<p>Let me boil functional programming down to its basics, the part you need before
we can really get started: variables are evil. Stop mutating them. It just makes
them more evil. If I could do just one thing to improve your Swift programs, it
would be to generate an electric keyboard shock every time you typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code>. Yeah, you’ll need it sometimes, but each time you should ask “is it worth
the shock?” And by “the shock,” I mean “hard to find bugs.”<sup id="fnref:computed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:computed" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to <a href="http://robnapier.net/i-dont-know-swift">I Don’t Know Swift</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this career advice? I am a web developer thinking about a “career change”
to iOS. Since I have no background in CocoaTouch or anything Apple, would your
advice be the same, to learn Swift?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve received different versions of this question since the day after Swift was
released, from ObjC lovers and haters, seasoned pros and the uninitiated. Having
had a very unusual (and privileged) career path, I’m probably not qualified to
give career advice, but I’ve been asked enough that maybe it’s worth talking
about. Maybe I can frame how to think about it, even if I can’t give you
satisfying certainty. Maybe that’s all advice really is.</p>
