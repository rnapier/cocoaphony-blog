  <div class="entry-content"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>

<p>Chapter 18 of <a href="http:/book">iOS:PTL</a> includes code for calculating points on a Bézier curve (see CurvyText in the <a href="/bookcode">sample code</a>). In the book, I hinted that this operation would likely be well suited to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/performance/accelerateframework.html">Accelerate framework</a>. The Accelerate framework provides hardware-accelerated vector operations. Solving Bézier equations seems a perfect fit. I’ll get more into Accelerate in later posts (including some thoughts on when to use it), but first I need to introduce some mathematical groundwork.</p>

<p>In this post, I’m targeting a specific kind of developer; one like myself. My mathematically inclined friends will find this so trivial that it’s hardly worth discussing. For those of you who have never seen a matrix before, this may be a bit dense. But if you’re like me, and once upon a time you actually took linear algebra, but today you wouldn’t know a transpose if it invited you to dinner, this may help. (The last time I computed a dot-product, the Newton hadn’t been released…) My goal isn’t to teach you Guassian elimination or eigenvalues. My goal is to show you by example the specific tools you need to convert the math you find in a book into matrices so you can calculate it faster. (And how to cheat with the incredible new tools available to us.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The most up-to-date source for this is now available at <a href="https://github.com/rnapier/RNCachingURLProtocol">github</a>.</em></p>

<p>Your programs need to deal gracefully with being offline. Mugunth Kumar has built an excellent toolkit that manages REST connections while offline called <a href="https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit">MKNetworkKit</a>, and Chapter 17 of <a href="http://iosptl.com">our book</a> is devoted to the ins-and-outs of this subject.</p>

<p>But sometimes you just have a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIWebView</code>, and you want to cache the last version of the page. You’d think that <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLCache</code> would handle this for you, but it’s much more complicated than that. <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSURLCache</code> doesn’t cache everything you’d think it would. Sometimes this is because of Apple’s decisions in order to save space. Just as often, however, it’s because the HTTP caching rules explicitly prevent caching a particular resource.</p>

<p>What I wanted was a simple mechanism for the following case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have a UIWebView that points to a website with embedded images</li>
  <li>When you’re online, you want the normal caching algorithms (nothing fancy)</li>
  <li>When you’re offline, you want to show the last version of the page</li>
</ul>

<p>My test case was simple: a webview that loads cnn.com (a nice complicated webpage with lots of images). Run it once. Quit. Turn off the network. Run it again. CNN should display.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have no idea what Amazon rankings really mean right around a book launch. Since they weight towards recent sales, I’m sure they spike, so you have to take these things with a grain of salt. But for at least a little while, we have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/377559011">#1 book in Mobile &amp; Wireless Programming</a>. I promise I won’t keep spamming you all with book updates, but it’s the first time I’ve been at the top of a “best sellers” list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve mentioned that Mugunth Kumar and I have been working on a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Pushing-Limits-Extraordinary/dp/1119961327">iOS 5 Programming Pushing the Limits</a>. It’s available now for pre-order and should be shipping by 12/20. It will be available in several eBook formats, though I don’t have all the details for that yet. I’m proud of what we’ve been able to put together here. The target audience are developers who have some iOS development under their belts, and are ready to move to the next level. Rather than just focus on the nuts and bolts of getting things done, we cover  how to do things well. In the process, we cover a lot of more advanced ground, often of frameworks with “Core” in their names like Core Animation, Core Text, and Core Foundation. We also address practical issues like how to optimize your application for offline work, and how to best handle REST and JSON.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update: You can now download the full example code from my book at <a href="https://github.com/rnapier/ios5ptl/tree/master/ch11/CryptPic/CryptPic">GitHub</a>. This comes from Chapter 11, “Batten the Hatches with Security Services.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update2: The things described here are handled automatically by <a href="https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor" target="_blank">RNCryptor</a>, which is an easier approach unless you want to write your own solution.</strong></p>

<p>I see a lot of example code out there showing how to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">CCCrypt()</code>, and most of it is unfortunately wrong. Since I just got finished writing about 10 pages of explanation for my upcoming book, I thought I’d post a shortened form here and hopefully help clear things up a little. This is going to be a little bit of a whirlwind, focused on the simplest case. If you want the gory details including performance improvements for large amounts of data, well, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119961327.html">the book</a> will be out later this year. :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The whole reason I learned Cocoa in the first place was so I could work on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pandoraboy/">PandoraBoy</a>. It’s a great project, but I haven’t really worked on it in quite some time. As Pandora changes, PandoraBoy becomes more and more broken. I barely have time to look at the patches that have been sent it, let alone apply them. My life has moved onto many other projects.</p>

<p>I’m actively looking for a new maintainer. It’s a good project, and the code base is in decent repair, though I don’t know if it builds with Xcode 4. The system basically works, but there’s a long list of things that could be improved, and some things that are now downright broken. If you’re interested, let me know and I’ll help hand it off. I took it over when I knew next to nothing about Macs. It’s a great place to learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t usually shill for my company’s products, but I’m  really impressed with the new <a href="http://www.kace.com/products/asset-management-appliance/">M300</a> we just put out. It’s an IT management appliance targeted at companies with 50-200 computers. I like how simple it makes setup; reminds me of Apple. Fewer “fiddly-knobs” and more “just works out of the box stop messing with it.” We’ve got the K1000 for those companies who need lots of configuration, but I’m excited to see us get into the SMB space like this. I know most of you don’t need an SMB IT management appliance, but it’s just a pretty cool box and I’m proud to be involved.
