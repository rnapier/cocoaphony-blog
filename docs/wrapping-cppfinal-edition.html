<div class="entry-content"><p>I have always strong recommended segregating Objective-C and C++ code with a thin Objective-C++ wrapper. I do not like Objective-C++. It is useful for what it does, but it is a mess of a &ldquo;language.&rdquo; It has many downsides, for slower compiles and poor debugging facilities, to confusing code and inefficient ARC code. <code>.mm</code> is a blight on your code. Never let it spread.</p>

<p>That said, Objective-C++ is invaluable for integrating C++ into Objective-C. And while I am not a great lover of C++, it is a very useful language and there is a great deal of excellent code written in it that is well-worth reusing in your Cocoa projects. Many of Apple&rsquo;s frameworks are implemented in C++.</p>

<p>So my recommendation for those who have existing C++ logic code has always been thus: write your UI in pure Objective-C (.m). Write your &ldquo;middleware&rdquo; in pure C++ (.cpp). And have a thin Objective-C++ (.mm) wrapper layer to glue them together. Your ObjC++ API should ideally exactly match your C++ API, just converting types (for instance converting std::string to and from NSString).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>(As a side note, I also recommend that OS-related things like file management, network management, and threading all be handled natively. GCD is much better than pthreads. NSURLConnection is much better than writing your own C++ networking layer in BSD sockets. But this is tangental to the main point.)</p>

<p>Saying all that, how do you wrap a C++ object so that Objective-C can read it? This used to be a question that required some significant thought. See <a href="http://robnapier.net/blog/wrapping-c-take-2-1-486">Wrapping C++, Take 2 Part 1</a> and <a href="http://robnapier.net/blog/wrapping-c-take-2-2-493">Part 2</a> for my previous thinking on the subject.</p>

<p>Improvements in Objective-C have made all of the previous hoop-jumping irrelevant. The problem all my previous solutions was trying to solve was that you had to declare ivars in the header. Your ivar was a C++ class (which might be in a namespace or might be a template), and that made it difficult to declare in the header without forcing all the importers to be ObjC++. So to solve this generally you needed opaque types, or at the very least forward declared structs, etc. And it was all a big pain.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s over. You can now declare all your ivars in the implementation file. So everything&rsquo;s easy. Your wrapper class can have C++ ivars without having any impact on users of the wrapper class.</p>

<p>Consider a simple C++ class (but throwing in the headache of a namespace):</p>

<pre><code>namespace MY {
class Cpp {
  public:
    std::string getName() { return _name; };
    void setName(std::string aName) { _name = aName; };
  private:
    std::string _name;
};
}
</code></pre>

<p>The wrapper for this is trivial:</p>

<pre><code>@interface CPPWrapper : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, copy) NSString *name;
@end

@interface CPPWrapper ()
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) MY::Cpp *cpp;
@end

@implementation CPPWrapper
@synthesize cpp = _cpp;

- (id)init {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    _cpp = new MY::Cpp();
  }
  return self;
}

- (void)dealloc {
  delete _cpp;
}

- (NSString *)name {
  return [NSString stringWithUTF8String:self.cpp-&gt;getName().c_str()];
}

- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  self.cpp-&gt;setName([aName UTF8String]);
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be easier really. The one headache that really remains in my experience is enums inside of a namespace (or more generally enums declared in a C++ header). The best solution is to use <code>#if __cplusplus</code> blocks to strip away the namespace and still declare the enum in pure C. Do this if at all possible. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll wind up with an C enum that mirrors the C++ enum. This is a maintenance nightmare, since changes to the C++ enum will often be missed in the ObjC enum, and you&rsquo;ll get very difficult-to-debug errors with enum mismatches.</p>

<p>Just to ask and answer a possible question: why <code>*Cpp</code> and not just <code>Cpp</code>? The reason is that in almost all cases the C++ object will be created outside of your wrappers. So in almost all cases, there&rsquo;s going to be a method like <code>initWithCpp:(Cpp *)cpp</code>. How does that work? Easy, wrap it in <code>#if __cplusplus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#if __cplusplus
#include "Cpp.h"
...
- (CppWrapper *)initWithCpp:(Cpp *)cpp;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, most of my research into opaque types and generally how to manage C++ wrappers has now become trivial. I&rsquo;m just giving one more post to let you all know that. (And because <a href="http://robnapier.net/blog/wrapping-c-take-2-1-486#comment-15967">Orpheus</a> asked.) Post comments if there are more questions.</p>
