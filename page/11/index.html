  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m switching jobs over this weekend from information security to Mac development. In the process, I&rsquo;m also moving mostly to work-from-home, taking over a corner of my wife&rsquo;s workrooms and turning it into a decent home office/lab. In the process of copying huge files around, I think I pushed my Linksys over the edge and it stopped talking on its WAN (PPPoE) port. In my researching trying to fix it, I learned that the Westell modems that Bellsouth gives you for FastAccess are in fact full routers. And actually I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a bit nicer router than the Linksys. So project #3 in the the &ldquo;get ready for new job&rdquo; turned out to be &ldquo;completely reorganize home network.&rdquo; I like the new setup, though. I can get to the Westell directly now (192.168.1.254) for diagnostics. And the Westell has a nice NAT setup system.</p>

<p>On the annoying front, for some reason my Microsoft Laser Mouse 6000 which has worked so well for me for so long at the office, now doesn&rsquo;t reliably click. Moving it works fine, it just doesn&rsquo;t always recognize clicking. It&rsquo;s driving me nuts. I&rsquo;m wondering what the change is. I&rsquo;m on Leopard now, which might impact it. Just not certain.</p>

<p>Moving over to Leopard on my primary box also meant spending a lot of time trying to get PandoraBoy happy. I&rsquo;ve been having trouble with the Shortcut Recorder palette for a long time now where IB won&rsquo;t load the palette. I think I&rsquo;ve finally gotten it sane again. Definitely staying on Xcode 2.5 for now. I&rsquo;ll wait for SR to get their Leopard IB3 support solid before I consider moving. I&rsquo;ve had requests to get PB running on 10.3.9, and I&rsquo;m not ready to try that in XCode3.</p>

<p>Oh, and first impressions of moving to Leopard: wow, Leopard rocks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have I mentioned recently how much I love Cocoa? Even when I hate Cocoa, I love working in it. And things that drive me nuts (like the lack of regexes) come along in due course (Leopard). I was listening to CocoaRadio today and there was a comment along these lines. Cocoa has been evolving for about 20 years now. Much of the core is carried over from NeXT. But rather than &ldquo;showing its age&rdquo; it keeps showing its wisdom, and those early guys thought it out well enough that Apple hasn&rsquo;t had to start over again and again as Windows has with Win32 to MFC/WTL to .NET. For how unusual Objective-C is, it&rsquo;s a constant rather than moving between C, C++, C#, and Java as the winds blow. (And the more I program in Objective-C, the more I enjoy it.)</p>

<p>Tonight I added a station-changing menu to PandoraBoy. There&rsquo;s still a lot to add to make it really useful (hotkey support and Applescript at least), but the core&rsquo;s there, and it wasn&rsquo;t hard. It forced me to simplify a slight duplication in the object model (PandoraControl and Controller were doing almost exactly the same work so I&rsquo;ve merged them). That cleaned up a lot of redundant code. Even after merging the two objects, Controller is under 400 lines of code, so I don&rsquo;t think I need to worry about splitting Controller back up some other way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More hacking on station lists tonight. So far it&rsquo;s been as easy as I hoped, once I created a reliable way to watch all Pandora traffic (through NSURLProtocols). The station list comes back as an XML document, and I can copy that off into an easy array for later use. The only thing I need to work more on is QuickMix management, since those are magically pulled out of the main channel list, and I should probably do the same to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked often with folks about XML and how there are so many good ways to compress it quite effectively and it&rsquo;s strange that XML developers have chosen not to do that. Rather, real XML winds up being insanely verbose and bloated on the wire. I hereby take back my earlier complaints. The fact that I can read XML by sniffing the traffic without having to apply any decoding (not even gunzip), and can recognize XML easily when I come across it, is one of the biggest boons to reverse engineering I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. Long live human readable data formats!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I knew I&rsquo;d run into this when I released PandoraBoy 0.4.0, and someone ran into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pandoraboy/issues/detail?id=17">Issue 17</a>. Moving from MacOS 10.4.10 to 10.4.11 included a massive change to WebKit, and the 0.4 line was meant to address this. Unfortunately I no longer had a 10.4.10 box to test against, and so I figured that something would probably break. Hope against hope, I figured everyone would have upgraded by now.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will now undertake a series of &ldquo;did this fix it&rdquo; patches and we&rsquo;ll see if we can get it working again. Hopefully the entire problem was my removal of decidePolicyForNewWindowAction: which never seems to be called in the new WebKit under Pandora (but I should have kept for completeness anyway). But it&rsquo;s possible that the problem is deeper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since I&rsquo;ve updated the Rob Report, but I have some things to chat about on the technical front. Most of my work these days is on the Mac, and my main hobby project is <a href="http://pandoraboy.googlecode.com/">PandoraBoy</a>, which will probably dominate these blog posts for a while. It&rsquo;s been a great project for teaching me how to deal with some interesting parts of Cocoa, while being small enough to keep my brain around.</p>

<p>My current project for PandoraBoy is getting control of station changing. I now have a set of proxy NSURLProtocols that I can use to eavesdrop on the Pandora traffic (rather than having to post requests like listStations twice). That&rsquo;s how I grab album art. I&rsquo;m using it to learn much more about how Pandora talks to its server, allowing me to provide more Mac-friendly ways to send those messages. I&rsquo;ve demonstrated now that I can send launchStationFromId messages from Cocoa, so now I just need to collect the results of listStations so I have the IDs to send. Shouldn&rsquo;t be hard now.</p>

<p>In the process, I discovered <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">FireBug</a>, which is just incredible. Using it, I understand Pandora&rsquo;s code much better and am now mulling about what I could do with all this information. But my next project will probably be talking to Airport Express (after I fix a couple of new bugs in the 0.4 line). I&rsquo;m pretty close to calling this thing 1.0&hellip;.</p>
