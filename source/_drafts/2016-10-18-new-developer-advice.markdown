D.J. wrote to ask a question, and I figured others might have the same one, so I'd write it once here.

> I was wondering if you would be so kind as to offer some advice to a fledgling iOS developer! I am hoping to get my first job in iOS development soon.

Welcome to the community! I love that we are a community, and I think becoming a part of it is an important piece in becoming a great developer. iOS changes so fast and so often, that no one can really be an expert in all of it. We rely on each other to teach us the parts we don't know yet. And there so many new parts that even newcomers can become the expert in this or that piece. Every new "Kit" (GameKit, SpriteKit, CarKit, whatever) is a new world no one has explored yet. Every new platform (watches, TVs, who knows what's next) is another opportunity.

I keep seeing people bring new ideas. Functional and reactive programming. Server-side Swift. Just this year I've met people building ray tracers and neural nets. You can even work on the Swift language itself. The team marks "bugs for beginners" [StarterBug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2961?jql=labels%20%3D%20StarterBug) so you can find them easily.  There are so many things that no one has built yet, and every time Swift changes we have to figure out again "what is good Swift?" So we're all learning (and stumbling, and re-learning) all the time. It's a great time to jump in.

We are a community. I'm probably biased because I hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cocoaphony), but I think we hang out on Twitter. We hang out in [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org) meetings. [We](http://cocoaconf.com) [hang](http://www.dotswift.io) [out](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com) [in](http://do-ios.com) [lots](https://www.playgroundscon.com) [and](http://nsscotland.com) [lots](http://pragmamark.org) [of](http://360idev.com) [conferences](http://nsspain.com). [Oh](https://swiftconf.com), [so](http://nsnorth.ca
) [many](https://swiftsummit.com) [conferences](http://www.uikonf.com). Go to the places we hang out. Talking to other iOS developers will make you a better developer. Ask questions. We're mostly kind, though not always as kind as we should be. Be kind, and remind us when we forget.

I learned the most about Cocoa by answering Stack Overflow questions. It wasn't that I knew a lot so I answered questions. It's that I answered questions so I learned a lot. I picked questions that seemed interesting and I researched the answer. It doesn't matter whether you get reputation or not. The worst thing that happens is someone else answers the question sooner or better than you do, and you learn something new anyway.

Learn to read ObjC. You do not need to learn how to write it. It is our Latin. So much Cocoa knowledge, from blog posts to documentation to Stack Overflow, is written in ObjC. Don't just wait for someone to translate it for you.
