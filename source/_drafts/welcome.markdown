I've been learning the guitar for a little less than a year now. My hope some day is to be a mediocre guitar player. With practice, I think I can get there, but I'm not there yet. Even so, I went to a guitar jam last week. It was my first time ever playing with other people. One of the guys loaned me a capo since I'd forgotten mine. They showed me chords I didn't know. They pushed me to lead a song, and they made a great effort to follow my ever-changing tempo and shaking voice. By the end of the three hours, I could barely even strum, but I'd had a fantastic time. The group encouraged me to come back.
