PB 0.5 is in my final testing. Just going to let it run a few hours before I post it on Monday. Adds station changing (finally) from menu, applescript or hotkeys. It's actually a much larger change than it looks. There was a lot of under-the-covers restructuring while I got that working.

Next plans: either investigate how to masquerade as iTunes (so that stuff that works with iTunes will transparently work with PandoraBoy), or work on some eye-candy features (full-screen mode, floating semi-transparent windows, etc.)
