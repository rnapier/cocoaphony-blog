I haven't forgotten about PandoraBoy, but I've been very busy these last couple of weeks. I'm now a full-time Mac programmer, and so I've been spending most of my time doing "real" hacking. Next week I go to Big Nerd Ranch for training, so I'll take PB with me to hack on.

I just built my first kernel extension and begun trying it out. Kernel programming is a whole different world... When it doesn't work, Gray Screen/Reboot. I'm glad that (a) OSX boots quick, and (b) I have a lot of computers...

I'm trying to waste system resources in a guaranteed way. I have these boxes with 2G of memory, and need to test problems that show up on 512MB machines and I don't have any 512MB sticks....

As I study Mac OS X Advanced Programming, I think I may be able to do this with mlock() and not have to use a kext. I've read other things that suggest that mlock() won't work the way I want in a user app. So testing is in my future.
