Well, I'm spending a little more time hacking PandoraBoy today. It now will compile under XCode3 for anyone playing along at home. I'm hoping to learn a lot this week to move things forward even more. Right now I'm <a href="http://www.serenbeinn.com/">here</a>, getting ready for <a href="http://bignerdranch.com/classes/cocoa.shtml">this</a>. Sometimes I think I picked a good life this time.

Now if I can just get back into my home computer to get my PB todo list.... Back into full-screen mode stuff.
