To all you aspiring Cocoa developers....

If you want to make a private framework, you need to remember to set the install path for it toÂ <span>@executable_path/../Frameworks</span>. Just copying it into your bundle isn't good enough. Otherwise your app is going to think it's in (~)/Library/Frameworks once you package it up and give it to other people.

In related news, PandoraBoy 0.5.1<span>a</span> is now released.
