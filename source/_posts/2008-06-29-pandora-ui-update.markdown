<div class="post-body entry-content">I'm back into PandoraBoy development. Looks like Pandora changed something with their last UI update, and it's broken PB and maybe also Pandora.FM (who uses the same API as we do). We're just not getting events anymore from the API. So I've dropped a note to their support list and we'll see if they can help us out at all. This is why Growl is broken; Pandora doesn't know when tracks change.</div>
