<div class="post-body entry-content">Neil Mix from Pandora contacted me today about the troubles I've had with the notification system. He showed me the code they use to text the API, and using that code has fixed a ton of problems. Anything based on knowing the current track is fixed in the 0.5.2. That includes growl, console log entries and Applescript. I'll have it out shortly.</div>
