Rob is a builder of treehouses, hiker, proud father, and in his spare 50-60 hours a week, a Mac and iPhone developer. When he's bored and wants good music, he hacks on <a href="http://pandoraboy.googlecode.com">PandoraBoy</a>. Cocoaphony is where he pontificates on various issues fascinating to Cocoa developers, and occasionally other topics of technical interest.

You can find more information about him on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rnapier" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. Or mail him at robnapier on gmail.
