For those of you worried about the trouble with PandoraBoy's hotkeys and Applescript, I've finally carved out some time to work on this stuff. I keep getting hung up on the hotkeys preference pane, which can't be opened in IB3, due to the use of the Shortcut Recorder IB Palette. The answer, I've always known, is just to rewrite the hotkey pref pane. It isn't that hard, I've just avoided it, and it's finally time to do it and fix a few bugs in the process.

Have I mentioned recently that PandoraBoy is an excellent small project to practice and hone your Cocoa skills?
