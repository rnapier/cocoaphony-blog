It's been quiet here for a while. I've been spending most of my time working on <a href="http://xmppframework.googlecode.com">XMPPFramework</a>, an opensource framework that makes it easier to build XMPP clients for Mac and iPhone. I've been working on this nonstop for several weeks now in preparation for a demo based on this, so there hasn't been a lot of time to post here. My code for that demo is done now, and I'm headed off on vacation for two weeks. So you should see more traffic here in July. I have quite a backlog of topics I just haven't had time to really capture.

If you're interested in a less edited form of my Cocoa musings, I still answer questions at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> (<a href="feed://stackoverflow.com/feeds/user/97337">feed</a>), and I've started experimenting with <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaphony">Twitter</a>, though I'm not sure yet how much I like tweeting.

See you all in July!
