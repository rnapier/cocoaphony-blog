The whole reason I learned Cocoa in the first place was so I could work on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pandoraboy/">PandoraBoy</a>. It's a great project, but I haven't really worked on it in quite some time. As Pandora changes, PandoraBoy becomes more and more broken. I barely have time to look at the patches that have been sent it, let alone apply them. My life has moved onto many other projects.

I'm actively looking for a new maintainer. It's a good project, and the code base is in decent repair, though I don't know if it builds with Xcode 4. The system basically works, but there's a long list of things that could be improved, and some things that are now downright broken. If you're interested, let me know and I'll help hand it off. I took it over when I knew next to nothing about Macs. It's a great place to learn.
