I went out to <a href="http://trianglecocoa.com/">NSCoder RTP</a> for the first time last night and met up with <a href="http://jsh.in">Josh Johnson</a>, who has been interested in taking up PandoraBoy development. So expect some changes coming up. Probably a move to github. Probably dropping 10.5 support soon. And who knows, it might even really work again.
