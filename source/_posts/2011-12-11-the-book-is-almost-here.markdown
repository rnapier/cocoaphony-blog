I've mentioned that Mugunth Kumar and I have been working on a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Pushing-Limits-Extraordinary/dp/1119961327">iOS 5 Programming Pushing the Limits</a>. It's available now for pre-order and should be shipping by 12/20. It will be available in several eBook formats, though I don't have all the details for that yet. I'm proud of what we've been able to put together here. The target audience are developers who have some iOS development under their belts, and are ready to move to the next level. Rather than just focus on the nuts and bolts of getting things done, we cover  how to do things well. In the process, we cover a lot of more advanced ground, often of frameworks with "Core" in their names like Core Animation, Core Text, and Core Foundation. We also address practical issues like how to optimize your application for offline work, and how to best handle REST and JSON.

Please send any comments or corrections to me at <a href="mailto:robnapier@gmail.com">robnapier@gmail.com</a>. In the meantime, you can take a look at the <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119961327,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html">example code</a>.
