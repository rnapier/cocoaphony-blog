I have no idea what Amazon rankings really mean right around a book launch. Since they weight towards recent sales, I'm sure they spike, so you have to take these things with a grain of salt. But for at least a little while, we have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/377559011">#1 book in Mobile & Wireless Programming</a>. I promise I won't keep spamming you all with book updates, but it's the first time I've been at the top of a "best sellers" list.
