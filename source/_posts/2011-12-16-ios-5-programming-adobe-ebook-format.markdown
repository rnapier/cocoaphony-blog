For those who have asked, the <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119961580.html">Adobe E-Book version</a> of iOS 5 Programming is available now from Wiley. I'm not certain yet when the Kindle version will be out, but I'm looking into it, along with getting a list of what other formats are planned.
