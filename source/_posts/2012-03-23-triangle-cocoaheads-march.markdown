Last night's <a href="http://meetup.trianglecocoa.com/events/49569052/">CocoaHeads</a> was a blast. <a href="http://www.dtsquaredsoftware.com/">Alondo</a>, you have to come give an intermediate/advanced talk on Storyboards. Thanks a lot to @scottpenrose for his lightning and thunder, and @flightblog for his inspiration (METAR gave me a lot of headaches, too). And of course, thanks especially to <a href="http://log.jsh.in/">Josh</a> for organizing everything. And a new place for NSCoder? You rock.

For those who didn't scribble notes fast enough, my Core Foundation presentation is attached (including the fix for my memory leak; was it Jay who found that?) I'll make sure to fix the code in the book for the next edition.
