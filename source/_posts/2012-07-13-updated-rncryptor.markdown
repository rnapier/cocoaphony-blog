I have brought the <a href="https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor">RNCryptor</a> async branch to master. This is a major change in API, but I believe much more flexible. I've stripped the API down quite a lot, so please let me know if there are missing features. I'm particularly interested in anyone who needs better support for reading and writing files. I haven't added any methods for that until I see how people are really using it.
