[Renaissance 2014](http://renaissance.io/2014) has been a great conference so far, and I loved getting the chance to discuss security today. If you're looking for the slides, code, and links, they're available at [github.com/rnapier/security-right](https://github.com/rnapier/security-right). If you missed my talk and would like to see it, don't forget that [the videos](https://renaissance.io/membership) will be available for $49 through tomorrow (Jan 31). After that, it'll be $99.

More later, but right now I'm more interested in this talk on software ethics, so I'm going to get back to listening.
