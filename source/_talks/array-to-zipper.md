When you think of the stdlib, you probably think first of the Collection types, like Array and Dictionary. And they’re definitely very important. But there’s much more to the stdlib beyond the generic collections. There are numbers and strings and mirrors and strides and zippers. If you’re ready to go a little off-road, there are the unsafe and the unmanaged. There are convertibles and hashables and the surprisingly tricky equatables.

The Swift stdlib is a rich and varied place, and in this session you’ll visit many of its lesser-known corners. Everything but Collections. That’s enough for a talk of its own. (See “Beyond Array. Getting the most out of Swift Collections.”)
