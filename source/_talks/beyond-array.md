The Swift stdlib comes with some very useful Collection types. You probably use Array and Dictionary in every app you write, maybe Set from time to time, and Range without really thinking about it. But there is so much more to Swift Collections, and even more coming in Swift 3. In this session you’ll learn how to build your own Iterators, Sequences, and Collections, and all the free methods you get for your trouble. And you’ll learn how to write cleaner code using powerful tools like map, flatMap, filter, and enumerated. C-style for loops are going away. If you’re still using them, you’ll want to attend this session to learn the many powerful Swifty alternatives.
