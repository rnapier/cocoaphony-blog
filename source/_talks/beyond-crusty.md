If you saw the “Crusty Talk” (Protocol Oriented Programming in Swift) at WWDC, you saw Apple announce Swift as the first “Protocol Oriented language.” If you immediately jumped into Xcode and tried to write a lot of protocol oriented code, you may have discovered that the promise isn’t quite the reality. In this talk, you’ll learn how to rethink your types so that you can avoid complex protocol problems without giving up their power.
