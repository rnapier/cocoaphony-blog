Learning From Our Elders: Applying functional insights without losing Swift

Swift is not a functional programming language. Pushing too hard to make it one fights Swift and breaks Cocoa.

But Swift has absorbed some fantastic lessons from the functional world, and while value types may not quite be the present, they are clearly the future. Weâ€™ll explore how decades of work in functional languages have influenced Swift, and how you can use those features best while staying true to Swift.
