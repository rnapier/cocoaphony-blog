UIKit Dynamics is new in iOS 7 and the rough edges still show a bit. It’s quirky. It’s backwards. It can be maddening. But it also can give you some very cool UI effects that are tricky to get other ways. UIKit Dynamics is the habanero of iOS. Too much will make you cry, lose your hair, and possibly hallucinate, but just enough can be exciting and delicious. In this session, you’ll go deep into this new frontier, learn the lay of the land, and tame the wilderness. Rob will rant a little bit, and then we’ll explode some stuff.
